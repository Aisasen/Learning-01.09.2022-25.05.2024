<b>Soobshestvom saserov predstavlyaetsya eta pasta.</b><BR>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Friends, don't you think you've been playing too much, huh? Well, let's take apart what you wrote in parts. Let's start with the fact that it is not necessary to open this topic. It seems that you are young, joking, shell-shocked and offended by life imbeciles, for whom everything is easy. That's probably been said a hundred times, but don't rock the boat. Because if you rock it, it will be bad, and it will be bad for everyone. I can tell you this to your face, are you ready to come and listen? You don't notice anything at all in your bloody frenzy. Stop and be human. It's better not to climb here. That's not it. This is not Chikatilo and not even the archives of the special services. All that shit you wrote is a simple pizdobolstvo, rimbaud you are indoor. The fact that you have written a lot will not make your life any better. There is a system that really works, there is no need to break this system. Because the consequences will be the saddest. To fuck is not to turn coolies. A lot of you have thawed out in the spring. They say about people like you: "Mom didn't want to, Dad didn't try." Delve into my message to you, try to analyze and draw conclusions for yourself. I fully understand that this message will cause additional interest, but I want to immediately warn the inquisitive - stop. The others just won't find it. At night I often feel my head rotting and dying. Slowly, the nose grows and hardens, gradually and imperceptibly the mustache disappears, and the darkening eyes, as if from the outside, see the pus flowing out of the ears. Living hands are trying to stop the flow of pus, they know that something most important flows out of the head along with the pus... But the pus flows through a kerchief, a handkerchief, a towel and a pillow, it cuts through the bed with heavy drops and painfully, contractively dries on the floor. The most important thing dries up, what should grow and think - but the head no longer thinks, it slowly crawls on the bed and licks the sweat accumulating in the folds of the sheet. The head stops growing and begins to shrink - the scientist's high forehead grows overgrown with coarse savage hair and disappears under them, disappears into them, so that soon, I think, the height of my forehead will be limited to the brow arches.

Fleshy ears, invisible against the background of the brain space spreading behind them, seem to increase against the background of a decrease in this space. I'm an IDIOT, an IDIOT, I think, I have a dead head, meaningless pig eyes, a thick mouth, and saliva from it slowly flows to the floor... Worms and people crawl in the dead head. The worms are cheerful and healthy, but the people are all faded, autumnal, and their heads also die and fall off like leaves. It will take a little more time, maybe 2-3 months, and their heads will all fall off and rot on the dirty ground, and a giant rain mushroom will grow out of the carrion. Then everyone will understand, looking at the mushroom, that a terrible death has finally come...

Death to people and their friends.</p>
